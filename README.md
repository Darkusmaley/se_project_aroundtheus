**Project features**

Display:grid -B y using the property grid, and its other associate properties, this project displays responsive design. The content is contained in grid-template-columns allowing for proper viewing on different screen sizes.

Display:grid - Flex box was used to propeerly align items at asmaller screen size to correct changes made to the project layout due to changes in screen size.

Media Queries - Media queries allowed for the optimization of the project between the indicated screen sizes by setting styles for the breakpoints were screen changing would occur.

BEM Flat structure -BEM Flat Structure allowed for the proper and seperate organization of all the css files. The seperation of css files into different blocks allows for consise viewing and simple organization.

Modular JS - In this project modular JS was used to seperate and organize different chunks of code. It allows for the creation of classes which can be personalized depending on their use.
